# COVID19_CT-Scan_Classifier

In this notebook, I'll build a convolutional neural network from the ground up in Keras. The intention is to classify CT-scans of Covid-19 and healthy patients, which for obvious reasons is very exciting! The dataset contains over 2000 images, with a roughly even split between the 2 classes.
